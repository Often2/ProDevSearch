## üìñ Project Overview

In a world overflowing with information, developers often struggle to find relevant, high-quality results quickly. Traditional search engines mix technical content with general articles, forums, and outdated information, wasting valuable development time.

**ProDevSearch** solves this problem. It's a vertical search engine built by developers, for developers. Our custom indexing and ranking algorithms are fine-tuned to prioritize official documentation, reputable technical blogs, and clean code examples from open-source projects. Say goodbye to noise and hello to productivity.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Developer-First Indexing:** We exclusively index sources that are highly regarded in the development community, including official docs, major tech blogs, and public code repositories.
* **Smart Filtering:** Easily filter results by programming language, library, or platform (e.g., `JavaScript`, `React`, `AWS`).
* **Code Snippet Recognition:** Our engine intelligently identifies and highlights code blocks directly in the search results for quick scanning.
* **Syntax-Aware Search:** Understands programming syntax to provide more relevant results for function names, error codes, and configuration variables.
* **Blazing Fast & Minimalist UI:** A clean, fast, and keyboard-navigable interface that gets out of your way. No ads, no tracking, just results.
* **Dark Mode by Default:** Because we care about your eyes during those late-night coding sessions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

To get a local copy up and running for development or contribution, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/ProDevSearch.git](https://github.com/your-username/ProDevSearch.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ProDevSearch
    ```
3.  **Open `index.html` in your browser:**
    Since this is a static site, you can simply open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser to see the application. For a more robust development experience, you can use a local server extension like "Live Server" in VS Code.

## üöÄ Usage

Using ProDevSearch is straightforward:

1.  **Enter Your Query:** Type your search term into the main search bar. This can be an error message, a function name, a concept, or a question.
2.  **Use Filter Prefixes (Optional):** To narrow your search, use prefixes like:
    * `js:` for JavaScript-specific results.
    * `py:` for Python.
    * `react:` for React library results.
    * *Example: `js: async await`*
3.  **Navigate Results:** Use your mouse or the arrow keys (`‚Üë` `‚Üì`) to navigate through the search results. Press `Enter` to open the selected link.
